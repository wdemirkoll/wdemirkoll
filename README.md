# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdüsselam Demirkol

I'm a self-motivated **developer** who started learning programming at a young age and continues to improve every day by studying and building projects at home. I believe in learning by doing, staying consistent, and turning knowledge into real-world practice.

Alongside programming, I am also **actively learning English** to improve my communication skills and grow as a global developer.
